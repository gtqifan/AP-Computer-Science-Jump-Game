# AP-Computer-Science-Drop-Game
This is a game I programmed for my AP Computer Science class for final project. The program includes JFrame which I learned from YouTube videos and a online class website called China University MOOC. Thank Ruobing(Icy) Chen, my teammate, who helped me to organize my thoughts and give me new ideas on improving my project.
