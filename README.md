# AP-Computer-Science-Jump-Game
This is a game I programmed for my AP Computer Science class for final project. The program includes JFrame which I learned from YouTube videos and a online class website called China University MOOC. Thank Ruobing(Icy) Chen, my teammate, who helped me to organize my thoughts and give me new ideas on improving my project in the perious version. 

In the newer version, the game actually becomes a real "Jump" game which now supports controlled by keyboard, two modes of trajectories, and changing the verticle force (which also equivilant to changing the angle.)
