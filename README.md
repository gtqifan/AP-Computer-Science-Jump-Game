# AP-Computer-Science-Drop-Game
This is a game I programmed for my AP Computer Science class for final project. The program includes JFrame which I learned from YouTube videos and a online class website called China University MOOC. Thank Ruobing(Icy) Chen, my teammate, who helped me to organize my thoughts and give me new ideas on improving my project.

Thank you, Mrs. Cunningham!
